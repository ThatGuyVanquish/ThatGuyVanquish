# Hello there :wave:

#### I'm Nave, a keyboard enthusiast that obviously got into the hobby because I program since I was 14, not because of "Fjell with lubed Holy Pandas".
~ Currently in Uni, studying a B.Sc in CS at Ben Gurion University.

~ I'm currently working on an NLP model for summarization using MT5, and a 3D Snake game for University courses.

##### Random things about yours truly:
* Exprienced in Java, C++, C, Intel Assembly (64 and 32bit!), Ocaml, JS and TS.
* Upgrading from Windows to Arch Linux (Manjaro)
* Scored 100 in the Systems Programming course and 92 in Compiler Construction.
* I daily an ergonomic keyboard with lubed and filmed Holy Bobas.
* Interned at Cybereason, where I've built a [dashboard](https://github.com/ThatGuyVanquish/CRStarshipDemo) to monitor Kubernetes on GCP through Prometheus.
* Love computer hardware, built my first computer at 13, then proceeded to physically modify it and overclock. Probably the reason I built my [Qt PC Part Picker](https://github.com/ThatGuyVanquish/QtPCPartPicker)(WIP).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why reverse Holy Bobas are the best dampened switch in existence. Or just any entry keyboard question because I've been using entry custom boards for the past 3 years.
